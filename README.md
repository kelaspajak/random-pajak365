# Pajak365
## Build blazing fast websites with Notion in light speed ‚ö°Ô∏è

Launch SEO friendly, blazing fast websites from Notion,Google Sheets, GitHub,  Airtable with Pajak365

## What's Pajak365

Pajak365 is a no-code platform that helps you launch websites from your favourite apps such as Notion, GitHub, Google Sheets, Airtable and more ü§Ø. Instead of letting you handle all the SEO stuff, Pajak365 automatically makes it SEO friendly for you. Don't like the default styles of Notion? No worries, you can edit the CSS till your heart's content. And one of my most favourite features - custom subdomains. Pajak365 lets you choose your subdomain of choice Eg. lalit.pajak365.com, your-name.pajak365.com, etc... Yeah, you got it right - Hashnode does that too. All you need to do is type out the content of your website in Notion and your website gets updated live, in real-time!!. You can make a website for your open source project on GitHub just by adding a `Pajak365.json` too!!. . There are a ton more features in Pajak365.
